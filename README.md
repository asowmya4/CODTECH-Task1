overview on the project
Projects:
1. Implement linear regression to predict housing prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Use a dataset like the Boston Housing dataset for training and evaluation.
2. Develop a fraud detection model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Use techniques like anomaly detection or supervised learning with imbalanced data.

Objective:
Develop two machine learning models: one to predict housing prices based on property features, and another to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The housing price model uses linear regression to analyze property data, while the fraud detection model leverages techniques suited for imbalanced data, such as anomaly detection or supervised classification.
Key Points:
•	Datasets: Boston Housing dataset for price prediction and a credit card fraud dataset for fraud detection.
•	Housing Price Model:
o	Features: Square footage, bedrooms, location.
o	Technique: Linear regression with feature engineering and evaluation using MSE and R-squared.
•	Fraud Detection Model:
o	Challenge: Handle imbalanced data.
o	Techniques: Supervised classification (e.g., Random Forest) with methods like SMOTE for balance, evaluated with Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC.
Technologies:
•	Python Libraries: Scikit-learn for model building, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations.
•	Environment: Google Colab
